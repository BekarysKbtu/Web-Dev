        <h2>Sunset by Google</h2>
        <p>Now the sun is sinking<br>
In the golden west;<br>
Birds and bees and children<br>
All have gone to rest;<br>
And the merry streamlet,<br>
As it runs along,<br>
With a voice of sweetness<br>
Sings its evening song.<br>
Cowslip, daisy, violet,<br>
In their little beds,<br>
All among the grasses<br>
Hide their heavy heads;<br>
There they’ll all, sweet darlings,<br>
Lie in the happy dreams.<br>
Till the rosy morning<br>
<strong>Wakes them with its beams.</strong></p>
