<h1>Whispers of Dawn</h1>
<p>In the hush before the dawn,<br>
    Where dreams and shadows meet,<br>
    The world is wrapped in velvet night,<br>
    A lullaby so sweet.<br>

    Stars like whispers trace the sky,<br>
    Their tales of ages spun,<br>
    Of love and loss, and whispered dreams,<br>
    Beneath the waiting sun.<br>

    The moon, a silver sentinel,<br>
    Keeps watch upon the deep,<br>
    While waves caress the sandy shore,<br>
    In rhythms soft and steep.<br>

    Through the trees, a tender breeze,<br>
    A sigh of nature’s grace,<br>
    It dances through the leaves and limbs,<br>
    A lover’s soft embrace.<br>

    Then comes the blush of morning light,<br>
    A promise gently cast,<br>
    That night will fade, and day will rise,<br>
    Though shadows always last.<br>

    For in the quiet of the dawn,<br>
    Where light and dark entwine,<br>
    We find the beauty of the world,<br>
    In every fleeting line.<br>
